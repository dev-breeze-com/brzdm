INTRODUCTION
    Brzdm is a graphical display/login manager for X11. It aims
    to be simple, fast and independent from the various desktop
    environments. Text and image display is handled by Imlib2.

    It is derived from SLim by Nobuhiro Iwamatsu <iwamatsu@nigauri.org>,
    which was based on the latest release of Login.app by Per Lid√©n.

    Features:
    - External themes and INI-style configuration
    - PNG support with alpha transparency
    - PNG / JPEG support for backgrounds
    - XFT / freetype support
    - Double or single (GDM-style) inputbox support
    - Keyutils authentication support
    - Secure auto-login support
    - User Photo Panel support
    - Time Clock Panel support
    - CMake build procedure

    Planned Features:
    - Wayland support
    - Kiosk support

USAGE
    To launch brzdm, execute the brzdm binary, Use the -d option
    if you want it to run as a daemon in the background.

    Enter username and password to login. The desktop file must reside
    at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.%desktop; and, is executed by default.
    The folder /usr/share/xsessions is accessed; and, the sessions entry
    is used for ordering the list of desktops.

    Special usernames (commands configurable in the config file):
    - F5/halt: halt the system
    - F6/reboot: reboot the system
    - F7/suspend: suspend the system (unsafe)
    - F8/kiosk: invoke the kiosk app
    - F9/console: start console login (optional)
    - ESC/exit: exit Brzdm

    Pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified command, see the
    configuration file; the default is to take a screenshot if the
    ImageMagick/GraphicsMagik 'import' program is available.
