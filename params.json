COPYRIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n  Brzdm is a simple graphical login manager for X11. It aims\r\n  to be simple, fast and independent from the various desktop\r\n  environments. Text and image display is handled by imlib2.\r\n\r\n  It is derived from SLim by Nobuhiro Iwamatsu <iwamatsu@nigauri.org>,\r\n  which was based on the latest release of Login.app by Per Lid√©n.\r\n\r\n  Features:\r\n\r\n   - Themes with INI-like configuration\r\n   - PNG support with alpha transparency\r\n   - PNG / JPEG support for backgrounds\r\n   - XFT / freetype support\r\n   - Double or single inputbox support\r\n   - Keyutils authentication support\r\n   - Secure auto-login support\r\n   - User Photo Panel support\r\n   - Time Clock Panel support\r\n   - CMake build procedure\r\n   - Wayland support (planned)\r\n   - Kiosk support (planned)\r\n\r\n\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\n\r\n This project requires:\r\n \r\n  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.8.2+\r\n  * GNU Make or equivalent.\r\n  * GCC or an alternative, conformant C++ compiler.\r\n  * Xorg/X11 libraries\r\n  * Imlib2 image library\r\n  * Freetype font library\r\n  * Nettle encryption library\r\n  * Keyutils keyring library (Upcoming version)\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n\r\n  To launch brzdm, execute the brzdm binary, Use the -d option\r\n  if you want it to run as a daemon in the background.\r\n\r\n  Enter username and password to login. The desktop file must reside\r\n  at /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.%desktop; and, is executed by default.\r\n  The folder /usr/share/xsessions is used by default; and, the\r\n  sessions entry is used for ordering the list of desktops.\r\n\r\n  Special usernames (commands configurable in the config file):\r\n  \r\n  - F5/halt: halt the system\r\n  - F6/reboot: reboot the system\r\n  - F7/suspend: suspend the system (unsafe)\r\n  - F8/kiosk: invoke the kiosk app  \r\n  \r\n  Pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified command, see the\r\n  configuration file; the default is to take a screenshot if the\r\n  ImageMagick/GraphicsMagik 'import' program is available.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEMES\r\n\r\n  See file THEMES\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING\r\n\r\n  This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we\r\n  have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that\r\n  the typical build invocation of \"./configure\" followed by \"make\" will work.\r\n  For a list of all possible build targets, use the command \"make help\".\r\n\r\n  NOTE: Please, do not delete the top-level Makefile.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n  Once the project has been built (see \"BUILDING\"),\r\n  execute \"sudo make install\". See the INSTALL file\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS\r\n\r\n  There an unresolved font access problem, when running on 64-bit machines.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUGS\r\n\r\n  Bug reports, patches and suggestions are much appreciated.\r\n  See the GitHub account https://dev-breeze-com.github.io/brzdm/\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n\r\n  Brzdm is copyright (c) 2015 Tsert.Inc <contact@tsert.com>\r\n  licensed through the GNU General Public License V3.0. \r\n\r\n  Slim is copyright (c) 2004-06 by Simone Rota, Johannes Winkelmann,\r\n  Nobuhiro Iwamatsu and is available under the GNU General Public\r\n  License.
